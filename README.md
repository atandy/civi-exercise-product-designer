Product Designer exercise for Civi


## Exercise Summary

### Scenario
You are tasked with designing the sign up flow and home screen of a new mobile app. The app is a free app that allows users to track real estate prices and available properties for sale throughout Latin America. You want to design a solution that would work well on Android or iOS devices.

### Here are some questions we have for you:
* What sign up method will you use? What are some of the trade-offs of one method over another?
* How will you know that your designs are successful in the short and long term?
* Are there any features that you think would be critical to the success of the app?
* What information is most important to include on the home screen?
* What research would you do, if any?
* Where might there be room for optimizing or improving the app's onboarding experience in the future?


## Exercise Deliverables and Submissions
### Exercise Format
For this assignment, you are welcome to create and submit the exercise in any format you would like (keynote, powerpoint, etc.). However, keep in mind that you could later be asked to present your work and talk through your approach. 

For this assignment, you need _not_ provide anything hi-fidelity, with the exception of one view of the home screen of the app. 

### Time Allocation
You can spend as much or little time as you would like on this exercise, but we have seen that it typically takes candidates between 2-6 hours (depending on how deep they wish to go). We would ideally like to receive your submission within 10 days; however, we understand that folks have other things going on and it can be difficult to find the time to complete assignments. If you need extra time, please just let us know.

### Submitting Your Work
Following completion of the assignment, please reach out to your primary point of contact and provide a link or attachment to your work. From there, we will be in touch. 

### Any Questions
If you have any questions about the assignment, you can reach out to your primary point of contact and are welcome to ask them there.

### Thank You
We look forward to reviewing your work! And thank you for considering Civi!!
